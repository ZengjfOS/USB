USB VIDEO CLASS EXAMPLE
-----------------------

  This example implements a USB video class (webcam) device that streams
  a set of 2 MJPEG frames repeatedly to the USB host over BULK Endpoint.
  The MJPEG video frames are stored in the memory of the FX3 device as 
  constant data.
  The example does not support full-speed operation.

  This example application demonstrates the following:

  1. The usage of the FX3 USB APIs to implement a standard USB video class
     device. The application shows how class specific USB control requests 
     can be processed at the application level.

  2. Configuration and data transfer setting through an bulk endpoint. 

  Files:

    * cyfx_gcc_startup.S : Start-up code for the ARM-9 core on the FX3
      device.  This assembly source file follows the syntax for the GNU
      assembler.

    * cyfxuvcinmem.h     : C header file that defines constants used by
      this example implementation.  Can be modified to select USB connection
      speed, endpoint numbers and properties etc.

    * cyfxuvcdscr.c      : C source file that contains USB descriptors
      used by this example. VID and PID is defined in this file.

    * cyfxuvcvidframes.c : C source file that contains the constant MJPEG
      video data that is repeatedly streamed to the USB host.

    * cyfxtx.c           : C source file that provides ThreadX RTOS wrapper
      functions and other utilites required by the FX3 firmware library.

    * cyfxuvcinmem.c     : Main C source file that implements this example.

    * makefile           : GNU make compliant build script for compiling
      this example.
